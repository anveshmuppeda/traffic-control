What is Q-learning?

#Objective:
#RL Based traffic signal Controller to maximize the traffic flow in the network which minimizes the risk of the trafficjams.

1. Sumo
2. Distributed Reinforcement Learning
3. QR


Conclustion:
We simulate our algorithm using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) on a real-world road network and compare it against the traditional Static Signalling (SS), Longest Queue First (LQF), and another RL-based approach of predictive n- step SARSA [1]. We evaluate these algorithms based on traffic parameters such as waiting time, queue length, and traffic dispersion time.
